***Project Description***:

1. **Commom Folder** contains CSS which is made with an aim of reusable in every project it contains 
2. For **Font Icons** I have used library package **(font-awesome v4.7.0)**[http://fontawesome.io] .
   It has been downloaded from (here)[https://www.cdnpkg.com/font-awesome/4.7.0].
3. **Exchange Rate Calculator** uses a API from platform (**Exchange Rate API**)[https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/] and it's using a free License and have been added legally.
4. **Music Player** and **Video Player** have mostly common css because of having similar structure.
5. **Form Validator** validates every letter typed in an input filed and works like a live form we always fill on the web.
7. **Movie Seat Booking** works like as that of real life seat booking application.

*Note:- All the above application does not store values in any places. However I have used local Storage of the browser to store values for music and video player and make them function properly. Value gets reset on every refresh.*
